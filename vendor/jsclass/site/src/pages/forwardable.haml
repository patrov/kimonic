  h2. Forwardable

  What was it the "Gang of Four":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns
  said? _Prefer delegation_. Delegation is the act of getting the receiver of a
  method call to respond by simply passing that call along to some other object.
  @Forwardable@, a port of Ruby's "@Forwardable@
  module":http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Forwardable.html, allows you to
  easily define instance methods that do just that.

  <pre>// In the browser
  JS.require('JS.Forwardable', function(Forwardable) { ... });

  // In CommonJS
  var Forwardable = require('jsclass/src/forward').Forwardable;</pre>

  Let's say you have a class that wraps a collection of objects, which it stores
  as an array in one of its instance properties. You might implement some
  methods for manipulating the array through the class' own interface:

  <pre>var RecordCollection = new Class({
      initialize: function() {
          this.records = [];
      },
      push: function(record) {
          return this.records.push(record);
      },
      shift: function() {
         return this.records.shift();
      }
  });</pre>

  Instead, you can @extend@ the class with @Forwardable@, then use
  @defineDelegators()@ to create the methods. @defineDelegators@ takes the name
  of the instance property to delegate calls to as the first argument, and the
  names of the delegated methods as the other arguments:

  <pre>var RecordCollection = new Class({
      extend: Forwardable,

      initialize: function() {
          this.records = [];
      }
  });
  RecordCollection.defineDelegators('records', 'push', 'shift');

  var recs = new RecordCollection();
  recs.push('The White Stripes - Icky Thump');
  recs.push('Battles - Mirrored');

  recs.shift()    // -> "The White Stripes - Icky Thump"</pre>

  If you need to define extra class methods, you need to change the notation
  slightly:

  <pre>var RecordCollection = new Class({
      extend: [Forwardable, {
          // class methods go here
      }],

      initialize: function() {
          this.records = [];
      }
  });</pre>

  If you want to give the delegating method a different name, use the
  @defineDelegator()@ (singular) method instead:

  <pre>// Add an instance method called 'add' that calls records.push
  RecordCollection.defineDelegator('records', 'push', 'add');</pre>
