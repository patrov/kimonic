  h2. MethodChain

  @MethodChain@ provides a mechanism for storing a sequence of method calls
  and then executing that sequence on any object you like.

  <pre>// In the browser
  JS.require('JS.MethodChain', function(MethodChain) { ... });

  // In CommonJS
  var MethodChain = require('jsclass/src/method_chain').MethodChain;</pre>

  Here's a quick example:

  <pre>var chain = new MethodChain();

  chain.map(function(s) { return s.toUpperCase() })
       .join(', ')
       .replace(/[aeiou]/ig, '_');

  chain.__exec__(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> "F__, B_R"</pre>

  Here, we create a new @MethodChain@ object called @chain@. We then call three
  methods on it, @map()@, @join()@ and @replace()@. @chain@ remembers the names
  of these methods and the arguments you used, then calls the stored chain on
  any object you pass to its @__exec__()@ method.

  If you call further methods on @chain@, they get added to the list:

  <pre>chain.split(/_+/);

  chain.__exec__(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> ["F", ", B", "R"]</pre>

  h3. How it works

  When you call a method like @map()@ on a @MethodChain@ instance, the instance
  stores the name of the method and any arguments you pass to it. All of @chain@'s
  methods return @chain@ again, allowing you to chain methods together as shown
  above.

  Any method you want to store in a chain has to exist in @MethodChain@'s list
  of method names in advance (my kingdom for a @method_missing@ feature in
  JavaScript!), or you will get an error. @MethodChain@ comes with over 300
  method names in place from the JavaScript core API to get you started. If you
  find that a method is missing, you can add it like so:

  <pre>// Add all methods from a class or object
  MethodChain.addMethods(jQuery);

  // Add methods by name
  MethodChain.addMethods(['methodName1', 'someOtherMethod']);</pre>

  All @MethodChain@ instances will then have the methods you've added.

  There are a few reserved methods on @MethodChain@ objects that you cannot use
  for chaining:

  * @__()@ - two underscores - more on this in a second
  * @____()@ - four underscores, used for storing method calls
  * @__exec__()@ - executes the stored chain against its argument
  * @toFunction()@ - returns a function that executes the chain when called

  h3. Changing scope using @__()@

  All chains have a method called @__()@ (that's two underscores) that you can
  use to change the scope of the chain. By default, each method in the chain is
  called on the return value of the previous method, but @__()@ lets you insert
  objects into the chain so that subsequent methods get called on said object.

  @__()@ also lets you insert anonymous functions into the chain. Within each
  function, @this@ refers to the return value of the previous method. Putting
  all this together, you could do:

  <pre>var chain = new MethodChain();

  chain.__(document).getElementsByTagName('p')
       .__(function() { console.log(this) });</pre>

  When we execute @chain@, the net effect is the same as:

  <pre>console.log(document.getElementsByTagName('p'));</pre>

  If you insert a function into the chain, its return value will be used as the
  receiving object for the next method call in the chain.

  h3. @toFunction()@

  The @toFunction@ method returns a function that executes the chain against its
  argument. For example, taking the first chain we created at the top of this
  page:

  <pre>var func = chain.toFunction();
  func(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> "F__, B_R"</pre>

  h3. The @wait()@ method

  @MethodChain@ adds a method called @wait()@ as an instance method and a class
  method to all classes and objects created with @jsclass@. This method allows
  you to delay execution of a chain against an object for a given about of time.

  <pre>var Fiddle = new Class({
      initialize: function(quantity) {
          this.size = quantity;
      },

      proclaim: function(thing) {
          console.log('I have ' + this.size + ' ' + thing + 's!');
      }
  });

  var fid = new Fiddle(99);

  // Call proclaim() after 5 seconds
  // prints "I have 99 problems!"
  fid.wait(5).proclaim('problem');</pre>
