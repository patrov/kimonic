  h2. Using modules

  In Ruby, a module is simply an object that stores methods. In @jsclass@, they
  are right at the core of the library, being responsible for handling
  inheritance rules, looking up methods and the like. @Module@ is a class, and
  @Class@ is also a class that happens to inherit from @Module@. That is:

  <pre>Class.superclass === Module</pre>

  I like to think of classes as modules that can be instantiated to create
  objects. But enough theory, the important thing is: modules store methods, and
  can be used to group related methods together so you can mix behaviour into
  classes.

  <pre>// In the browser:
  JS.require('JS.Module', function(Module) { ... });

  // In CommonJS:
  var Module = require('jsclass/src/core').Module;</pre>

  For example, suppose you want to encapsulate the idea of being able to compare
  objects to each other so they can be sorted. (@jsclass@ comes with a
  "@Comparable@":/comparable.html module, so you don't have to write you own.) A
  module for achieving this might look like:

  <pre>var Comparable = new Module({
      lt: function(object) {
          return this.compareTo(object) == -1;
      },
      lte: function(object) {
          return this.compareTo(object) < 1;
      },
      gt: function(object) {
          return this.compareTo(object) == 1;
      },
      gte: function(object) {
          return this.compareTo(object) > -1;
      },
      eq: function(object) {
          return this.compareTo(object) == 0;
      }
  });</pre>

  This @Comparable@ module cannot be instantiated -- you cannot create new
  objects from it. But you can add the module to a class, and the class will
  gain the methods stored in the module. This module will work with any class
  with a @compareTo()@ method:

  <pre>var User = new Class({
      include: Comparable,

      initialize: function(name) {
          this.name = name;
      },

      compareTo: function(user) {
          if (this.name < user.name)
              return -1;
          else if (this.name > user.name)
              return 1;
          else
              return 0;
      }
  });</pre>

  We now have users with comparison methods:

  <pre>var jack = new User('Jack'), jill = new User('Jill');
  jack.lt(jill)   // -> true
  jack.gt(jill)   // -> false
  jill.gt(jack)   // -> true</pre>

  Also note that the methods stored in a module are not methods _of_ the module.
  That is, you cannot call @Comparable.lt(someObject)@, for example. The methods
  can only be called on objects whose class includes the module.

  If you want to mix several modules into your class, you need to specify them
  as an array, in the order you want them to be included, for example:

  <pre>var Foo = new Class({
      include: [ModA, ModB, ModC],

      initialize: function() {
          // ...
      }
  });</pre>

  Alternatively, you could create the class first, then mix the modules in
  afterward:

  <pre>var Foo = new Class({
      initialize: function() {
          // ...
      }
  });
  Foo.include(ModA);
  Foo.include(ModB);
  Foo.include(ModC);</pre>

  h3. Modules and @callSuper()@

  When you mix a module into a class, the module becomes part of the class'
  'ancestry'. That means that the class' own methods can use @callSuper()@ if
  they override any methods inherited from the module. For example, let's
  override @Comparable#eq()@ to log its results:

  <pre>User.define('eq', function(user) {
      var areEqual = this.callSuper();
      if (areEqual) console.log("Found two equal objects!");
      return areEqual;
  });</pre>

  Note we don't need to pass @user@ into @callSuper()@ - it gets passed in
  automatically unless we override it. For more information on inheritance,
